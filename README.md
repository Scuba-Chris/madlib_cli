# madlib_cli

**Author**: Chris Ceder
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
The lab was to build a madlib program in python. The program took in 21 user inputs. The inputs are then used to fill in the blank sections of the text file. Then the madlib is printed out for the user to read the paragraph with their inputs.

## Getting Started
To build this program you first need to build a out a python file that takes in 21 user inputs and stores them in a list. Then, you need to create a function that reads the txt file containing the madlib text. The final piece is a function that takes in the user inputs, the txt from that madlib txt file, and combines them to create a complete the madlib in a new txt file.

## Architecture
The program is built using python. It is a madlib text based command line application. That takes in user inputs and outputs a completed madlib paragraph.

## API
No APIs are being used in this program.
